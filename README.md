# GLIP

This is a fork of the [official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP) with some cleanup, bug fixes, and dependency cleaning. This is targeting using the pretrained models for inference. In particular, we

1. Change the package name from `"maskrcnn"` to `"glip"`.
2. Remove a lot of unncessary dependencies.
3. Build wheels and publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/glip-object-detection/).
